Update About Elastic Load Balancer in AWS issue

For 504 Gateway Timeout error control

1. In ELB, we need to increase the idle timeout to 300 seconds. There is option to set this value through aws management console.
2. We have increased the maximum execution time from 1 minutes to 5 minutes (recommendated).
3. KeepAlive should be set to On. In our case, it is enabled. (It reflects in the php info file - https://api.yosicare.com/php/info.php)    


yosi-yosicare   - Application
yosi-ansible   - Configs
ansible-devansible - Vagrant



1. Health First - QA discussion.

2. Lokking into AWS ELB issue fixes.
